# Describe-an-image
A computer program that takes an image as input and produces its relevant description as output.
Just prior to the recent development of Deep Neural Networks this problem was inconceivable even by the most advanced researchers in Computer Vision. But with the advent of Deep Learning this problem can be solved very easily if we have the required dataset.

Problems that can be solved using this - 
1. Aid to the blind.
2. Self driving cars.
3. CCTV
4. Web Image Search

Tech stack used - asic Deep Learning concepts like Multi-layered Perceptrons, Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Transfer Learning, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Overfitting, Probability, Text Processing, Python syntax and data structures, Keras library.

Dataset Used - Flickr8K(containing8k images)
